Testing 

The testing process I went through is listed below:
- Testing user stories.
- Validating the code.
- Checking if the website is repsonsive.
- Manually testing the websites features.

Testing user stories

Project Stakeholders:
- The 7th's Group leader wanted a website that offers a small introduction into what scouts is and what the 7th offers. I have included and a small section on scouting with a promo video and a page showing what the 7th do and what events they go to.

New users:
- The first user who wanted to learn more about the group and the events is able to see exactly what the group do at the weekly meetings and what sort of events are on and how frequent they are.
- The second user wanted to find a local scout group and find a bit about them. I have included an introduction into the 7th and what they do with some of the upcoming events.

Returning users:
- The first user returns to the website to keep up to date with the groups events. I have included a calandar so that users are able to keep up to date with all of the events going on.
- The second returning used the website to record what events were coming up to keep up to date with them. I have included the diary for at least 6 months in advance so that the users know what is happening very far in advance.

Tablet user
- The tablet user wanted the website to be responsive on a tablet so that they could use it on their tablet. I have made the website so that it is responsive on tablets and phones as well as desktops.

Validating the the HTML and CSS
-
HTML
-
To validate my HTML I used the W3C markup validation service.

Index.html errors:
- P element was included with no end tag (fixed)
- Frameborder element was obsolete (fixed)

7thpage.html errors:
-

Events.html:
-

Responsiveness
-
- To check if my website was responsive I first used googles inspect tool to test what my website looked like at different sizes.
- I got the website up on my phone to test how it looked on there too.

Manually testing the websites features
-
The last bit of testing I did was going through all of the individual interactive features to see if they worked as inteneded. I went through each of the nav bar buttons on each of the pages and each of the links on all of the pages to see if they linked to the correct places.
