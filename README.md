# 7th Gateshead Scouts


7th Gateshead Scouts is my local scout group where I help as a Cub leader. Currently the scout group does not have a website to advertise exactly what the group offers in terms of activities and experiences. My aim for this project is to create a website for the 7th Gateshead Scouts so that they are able to advertise the group.

The idea to create a website for the 7th came to me when I was discussing with the Group leader about having a bigger presence online as so far the group hasn't got any social media accouts or a website to help advertise the group. The group has space and could benefit from some new scouts.

This is my first of four milestone projects that make up my Full Stack Web Development course at THE CODE INSTITUTE. The main requirements are to make a responsive website with HTML5 and CSS3

Here is a link to my live website  https://callumhearne.github.io/7th-Gateshead-Scouts/

# Wireframing my project on figma

Before I started to create my website on Github/Gitpod I first designed it on Figma so that I had an idea on what I was creating and how I was going to create. This allowed me to have an understanding of the tools I was going to use before I made it.
